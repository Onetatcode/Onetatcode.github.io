## Project Overview

### Tech Stack
* **SIEM:** Wazuh
* **Monitoring:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
* **Firewall:** pfSense
* **IDS/IPS:** Snort

### Current Progress
I have successfully deployed the Wazuh manager and am currently configuring File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) to detect unauthorized changes.
