# 👋 Hello, I'm Muhammad Ali.

Welcome to my personal portfolio! I am a **Cybersecurity Undergraduate** at **Capital University of Science & Technology** and an aspiring **SOC Analyst**.

### 🚀 What I Do
I specialize in **Blue Team Operations** and **Network Defense**. My passion lies in understanding how attacks work so I can build better defenses against them.

Currently, I am focused on:
* **SOC Architecture:** Building and monitoring home labs using **Wazuh**, **ELK Stack**, and **Snort**.
* **CTF Challenges:** Active player on **TryHackMe** and **HackTheBox** to sharpen my offensive skills.
* **Hardware Hacking:** Exploring the intersection of physical and digital security as a hobbyist.

### 🎯 Objective
This site serves as a documentation of my journey, where I publish writeups for CTF challenges, research on malware analysis, and guides on setting up security tools.

Feel free to check out my **[Projects](/categories/projects)** or connect with me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-ali-53a46b28a)**.
